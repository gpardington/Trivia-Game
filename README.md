# Trivia-Game
A multiple choice trivia game that uses BootStrap and JavaScript. Once the page loads, a timer starts that ends the game if the questions haven't all been answered. At the end, the site will tell you how many questions you got correct. If you finish your quiz before the timer ends, you can submit it to get your results early.
